/**
 * An {@code Ant} is created at a specific position of an {@link AntField} with
 * an initial {@code stepCount}. When running an Ant, it will lookup the values
 * on the current and all surrounding {@link AntField.Field}
 * (Moore-neighborhood) instances and test if the position is free, i.e. has a
 * value of {@code 0}, or if the value is greater than the {@code stepCount} of
 * this Ant. For both cases, the Ant will set the value of the {@code Field} at
 * the visited position to its own {@code stepCount+1}. After an {@code Ant} has
 * successfully visited one field, it will create new {@code Ant} instances with
 * an incremented {@code stepCount} to visit the other available {@code Field}
 * elements. The Ant will run until it finds no more {@code Field} elements in
 * its neighborhood to be altered.
